# Comparative Analysis of nGPT, PEGASUS, and BART in Abstractive Text Summarization

## Introduction

This project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of **nGPT** (Nvidia's model) against two state-of-the-art abstractive text summarization models: **PEGASUS** (Google) and **BART** (Facebook). The focus is on assessing nGPT's claims of achieving **4-20x faster training times** and **improved stability** for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of abstractive text summarization.

## Objectives

- **Assess nGPT's Efficiency**: Validate nGPT's claims of faster training times and improved stability.
- **Compare Performance**: Evaluate the summarization quality of nGPT, PEGASUS, and BART.
- **Stability Analysis**: Investigate the stability of these models during training and inference.

## Methodology

### Model Training

- **PEGASUS and BART**: Train base models on standardized dataset CNN/Daily Mail. 
- **nGPT**: Adapt nGPT for abstractive summarization, optimizing its performance for the task.

### Performance Metrics

- **ROUGE Scores**: Use ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L to measure the quality of summaries.
- **Training Speed**: Measure the time taken for each epoch during training.
- **Stability**: Monitor loss curves, gradient norms, and other stability indicators.

### Comparison

- **Summarization Quality**: Compare the summaries generated by each model.
- **Training Efficiency**: Analyze the training times and resource utilization.
- **Stability**: Evaluate how each model handles training and inference stability.
